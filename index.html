          <p>
            Python 3.0 was released in 2008. The final 2.x version 2.7 release
            came out in mid-2010, with a statement of extended support for this
            end-of-life release. The 2.x branch will see no new major releases
            after that. 3.x is under active development and has already seen
            over five years of stable releases, including version 3.3 in 2012,
            3.4 in 2014, 3.5 in 2015, and 3.6 in 2016. This means that all
            recent standard library improvements, for example, are only
            available by default in Python 3.x.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guido van Rossum (the original creator of the Python language)
            decided to clean up Python 2.x properly, with less regard for
            backwards compatibility than is the case for new releases in the 2.x
            range. The most drastic improvement is the better Unicode support
            (with all text strings being Unicode by default) as well as saner
            bytes/Unicode separation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides, several aspects of the core language (such as print and
            exec being statements, integers using floor division) have been
            adjusted to be easier for newcomers to learn and to be more
            consistent with the rest of the language, and old cruft has been
            removed (for example, all classes are now new-style, "range()"
            returns a memory efficient iterable, not a list as in 2.x).
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the broader Python ecosystem has amassed a significant
            amount of quality software over the years. The downside of breaking
            backwards compatibility in 3.x is that some of that software
            (especially in-house software in companies) still doesn't work on
            3.x yet.

            Next, install the Python interpreter on your computer. This is the
            program that reads Python programs and carries out their
            instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming.
            Mac OSX distributions from 10.3 (Panther) and up include a version
            of Python, which may be suitable for beginning despite being as much
            as two years out of date. Linux distributions also frequently
            include Python, which is readily upgraded.

            This reference manual describes the Python programming language. It
            is not intended as a tutorial.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use
            English rather than formal specifications for everything except
            syntax and lexical analysis. This should make the document more
            understandable to the average reader, but will leave room for
            ambiguities. Consequently, if you were coming from Mars and tried to
            re-implement Python from this document alone, you might have to
            guess things and in fact you would probably end up implementing
            quite a different language. On the other hand, if you are using
            Python and wonder what the precise rules about a particular area of
            the language are, you should definitely be able to find them here.
            If you would like to see a more formal definition of the language,
            maybe you could volunteer your time — or invent a cloning machine
            :-).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is dangerous to add too many implementation details to a language
            reference document — the implementation may change, and other
            implementations of the same language may work differently. On the
            other hand, CPython is the one Python implementation in widespread
            use (although alternate implementations continue to gain support),
            and its particular quirks are sometimes worth being mentioned,
            especially where the implementation imposes additional limitations.
            Therefore, you’ll find short “implementation notes” sprinkled
            throughout the text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every Python implementation comes with a number of built-in and
            standard modules. These are documented in
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index"
              >The Python Standard Library</a
            >. A few built-in modules are mentioned when they interact in a
            significant way with the language definition.
          </p>
          <h3>Alternate Implementations</h3>
          <ul class="introduction-ul">
            <li>
              <span><strong>CPython</strong></span>
              <p>
                This is the original and most-maintained implementation of
                Python, written in C. New language features generally appear
                here first.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><strong>Jython</strong></span>
              <p>
                Python implemented in Java. This implementation can be used as a
                scripting language for Java applications, or can be used to
                create applications using the Java class libraries. It is also
                often used to create tests for Java libraries. More information
                can be found at the
                <a href="https://www.jython.org/">Jython website</a>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><strong>Python for .NET</strong></span>
              <p>
                This implementation actually uses the CPython implementation,
                but is a managed .NET application and makes .NET libraries
                available. It was created by Brian Lloyd. For more information,
                see the

                >.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span><strong>IronPython</strong></span>
              <p>
                An alternate Python for .NET. Unlike Python.NET, this is a
                complete Python implementation that generates IL, and compiles
                Python code directly to .NET assemblies. It was created by Jim
                Hugunin, the original creator of Jython. For more information,
                see the
                <a href="https://ironpython.net/">IronPython website</a>.

            <li>
              <span><strong>PyPy</strong></span>
              <p>
                An implementation of Python written completely in Python. It
                supports several advanced features not found in other
                implementations like stackless support and a Just in Time
                compiler. One of the goals of the project is to encourage
                experimentation with the language itself by making it easier to
                modify the interpreter (since it is written in Python).
                Additional information is available on
